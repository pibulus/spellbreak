Break the screen spell

## Description

**Your shoulders holding court since Tuesday?**

Spellbreak breaks the digital hypnosis with mystical break reminders that actually work. Every 20 minutes (or whatever you choose), watch your screen transform into flowing aurora waves while your body remembers how to exist.

**Street-smart break wisdom**
Messages that know your patterns. "The trance gets comfortable." "Your jaw keeping score?" "Screen's got your number." NY tarot reader energy, not corporate wellness speak.

**Beautiful, unskippable (but skippable)**
Full-screen mystical overlays with flowing waves and particles. Need to skip? Hold the button—one second per minute of break time. Just enough friction to make you think twice.

**Features that matter:**
• Customizable break intervals (5-60 minutes)
• Aurora, cosmic, or lava visual themes
• Time-aware color palettes (dawn/day/evening/night)
• Optional ambient sounds
• Break completion tracking
• Zero data collection

**Privacy first:**
No accounts. No analytics. No network requests. Your break patterns stay on your Mac where they belong.

**The details:**
• Native macOS app (Ventura 13.0+)
• Lightweight menu bar presence
• Works offline forever
• Open source

Break the spell. Your spine will thank you.

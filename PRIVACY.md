# Privacy Policy for Spellbreak

*Last updated: January 20, 2025*

## Your Privacy Matters

Spellbreak respects your privacy. We built this app to help you take healthy breaks, not to collect your data.

## What We Collect

**Nothing.** Spellbreak collects zero user data.

- ❌ No analytics
- ❌ No tracking
- ❌ No telemetry
- ❌ No crash reporting
- ❌ No network requests
- ❌ No user accounts
- ❌ No cloud storage

## What Stays on Your Device

All your preferences stay local:
- Break interval settings
- Break duration preferences
- Sound and theme choices
- Completion statistics

These are stored in macOS's standard UserDefaults and never leave your Mac.

## Permissions We Request

**None required.** Spellbreak works without special permissions.

Optional permissions you may grant:
- **Notifications**: To remind you about breaks (optional)
- **Launch at Login**: To start automatically (optional)

## Third-Party Services

Spellbreak uses no third-party services. No data is sent anywhere, ever.

## Open Source

Spellbreak's source code is available at [github.com/pibulus/spellbreak](https://github.com/pibulus/spellbreak)
